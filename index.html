        Each project here is written as a small case study. The goal is to show how I think about stories, audiences and systems, not just to list tools.

          <h3>Feeling a Story Without Language</h3>
          <div class="tagline">Cross cultural reception study of video narratives</div>
          <p>
            A small user study where participants watched short films in languages they did not speak and still tracked tension and release. This became my first structured attempt to study emotion that travels ahead of meaning.

          <h3>Teaching Algorithms To Write Ads</h3>
          <div class="tagline">AI storyboard engine for short form campaigns</div>
          <p>
            At a marketing startup I worked on a pipeline that uses large language models to write scripts for Reels and Shorts, then refines them through A/B tests. The project showed me how optimisation pipelines favour loud, high arousal emotions.

          <p>
            Stand up sets across different cities where I treat jokes as small experiments. I track how the same story about immigrant frugality can feel healing in one room and offensive once it circulates as a short clip online.

          <p>
            At Optiwise I helped migrate messy JSON from marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart into a SQL schema that supports analytics on more than two million seller records. The goal was to turn raw scraped pages into reliable signals.

          <div class="tagline">Real time sentiment and topic shifts</div>
          <p>
            For a university project I built a small pipeline that streams tweets around an event, runs basic NLP and visualises how sentiment and topics evolve over time. It was my first taste of live text as a moving crowd.
