        I work where stories, audiences and systems meet. I grew up in a small village in Andhra listening to my grandmother tell mythology, tried to build a VR storytelling startup at seventeen, studied in Spain, Taiwan and the United States, and now split my time between stand up comedy and working with data and AI in New York.

      <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>
      <p>
        As a kid I was more obsessed with movies and stories than with exams. At seventeen I moved away from home for engineering and tried my first startup idea: a VR based way to showcase local tourism and stories from small towns. The project did not go far, but it pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me realise how much I care about how people experience narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        That curiosity took me across three continents. In my first masters in Global Entrepreneurship Management I studied and travelled through Spain, Taiwan and the Bay Area, and wrote my thesis on storytelling in marketing. In my second masters in Data Analytics I learned to work with data at scale and started thinking more seriously about how platforms and algorithms shape what people see.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the way I became a comic. I started stand up in Taipei as a dare to myself because I was scared of public speaking. Since then I have performed in Barcelona, San Francisco and New York and have opened for Netflix comedians. On stage I watch emotional psychology happen in real time and use that as a kind of live lab.

            For my entrepreneurship masters I ran a small user study where people watched short films in languages they did not speak and still tracked tension and release. I treated their written responses as data and coded where they felt the story change.

            At a marketing startup I worked on a pipeline that uses large language models to write scripts for short form video campaigns and then refines them with performance data and A/B tests. It showed me how optimisation pipelines push content toward loud, high arousal emotions.

            I treat my stand up sets as small experiments. The same story about immigrant frugality can feel like shared recognition in one room and like stereotyping once the clip travels through algorithms. I track these shifts to understand context collapse.

    <!-- COMEDY SECTION -->
    <section style="margin-top:2.5rem;">
      <h2 class="section-title">Stand up and performance</h2>
      <p>
        I have been doing stand up for about four years, starting in Taipei and later in Barcelona, San Francisco and New York. I have performed on lineups with Netflix comics and regularly host and open shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now my favourite questions on stage are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>why the same joke can feel healing for one person and offensive for another</li>
        <li>how much context a room needs before a risky bit feels safe</li>
        <li>what changes when clips leave the room and turn into content</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I use these questions directly in my research ideas and see the stage as a place to test theories in front of real people.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#6b7280;">
        (If you are reading this as part of a PhD application, I am happy to share private links to clips rather than public ones.)

    <!-- RESEARCH SECTION -->
    <section style="margin-top:2.5rem;">
      <h2 class="section-title">Research direction</h2>
      <p>
        I am preparing PhD applications in Communication, Theatre and Media in New York. The core questions I am interested in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how stories and jokes travel emotionally across cultures on digital platforms</li>
        <li>how algorithmic curation and context collapse change the role of humour</li>
        <li>what kinds of embodied knowledge are lost when everything is optimised for engagement</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I want to combine computational analysis of clips and comments, close reading of scripts and practice based work from stand up to study these questions more formally. The <a href="research.html">research agenda page</a> has a bit more detail.
