  <h2>From nervous kid to open mics</h2>
  <p>
    I was not a natural performer. I used to dread classroom presentations. During graduate school in Taipei I said yes to a dare to try stand up comedy for five minutes. The first set was shaky but it opened a path that now runs through open mics and shows in Taipei, Barcelona, San Francisco and New York, including opening for Netflix comics.
  </p>

  <h2>Using sets as experiments</h2>
  <p>
    I treat my sets as small experiments where I vary framing, pacing and wording and watch how rooms respond. One recurring example is a story about immigrant frugality.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In a club full of people who share that background, it produces a collective sigh of recognition and knowing laughter</li>
    <li>When the same story is clipped into a short and pushed through recommendation algorithms, people who do not share the context sometimes read it as internalised racism or stereotyping</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The emotional function of the bit shifts from healing to offensive as it moves across publics.
  </p>

  <h2>What I track</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Room composition and vibe before the show</li>
    <li>Where laughter is loud, where it is tight and where it disappears</li>
    <li>After show comments, especially from people who felt seen or uncomfortable</li>
    <li>How clips of the same material behave online in comments and engagement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why this is research for me</h2>
  <p>
    Comedy gives me something that lab work cannot: live, embodied feedback from real people who have not come to fill out a survey. Using this practice based lens, I can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>see how humour works as a quick way to test boundaries around identity and power</li>
    <li>study how context collapse on platforms changes the role of a joke</li>
    <li>generate questions that later feed into more formal analysis and PhD level work</li>
  </ul>
