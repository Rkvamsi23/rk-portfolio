  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p>
    I wanted to know whether people can still follow the emotional arc of a story when they do not understand the language, and which elements carry emotion across cultures.
  </p>

  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    This project grew out of my Global Entrepreneurship Management program. I was already obsessed with films and stand up, and I wanted a structured way to study how narrative feels to someone who is outside the language.
  </p>

  <h2>Study design</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Recruited a small group of participants with different language backgrounds</li>
    <li>Selected short narrative clips in languages none of them spoke</li>
    <li>After each clip they wrote:
      <ul>
        <li>what they thought was happening</li>
        <li>where they felt tension, relief or a change in the story</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Treated responses as qualitative data and coded for:
      <ul>
        <li>descriptions of tension, relief and character change</li>
        <li>mentions of confusion, surprise or clarity</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Mapped those codes to the actual narrative beats in the script</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Findings</h2>
  <p>
    Even when participants could not summarise the full plot, many agreed on the exact moments where something important shifted. They relied on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>visual rhythm and pacing</li>
    <li>framing and body language</li>
    <li>music cues around key turns</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    A key outcome was that they often shared an emotional sense of tension and release before they could put the story into words.
  </p>

  <h2>My role and methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Framed the research question and designed the experiment</li>
    <li>Ran all sessions and collected responses</li>
    <li>Coded and analysed the data using simple qualitative coding and basic descriptive stats</li>
    <li>Wrote up the work as my thesis on storytelling and marketing</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What I took forward</h2>
  <p>
    This became my first structured attempt to answer two questions that still guide my work:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>how people feel a story when meaning is incomplete</li>
    <li>how that response shifts when language and culture change</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Later projects on humour and platforms build directly on this idea that emotion can move ahead of clear semantic understanding.
