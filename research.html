  <h1>Research agenda</h1>
  <p>
    I work at the intersection of storytelling, emotion and technical systems. My practice is stand up comedy, my tools are data and AI, and my questions sit between communication, media and performance studies.
  </p>

  <h2>Core questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do stories and jokes travel emotionally across cultures when they move through digital platforms</li>
    <li>How do algorithmic curation and context collapse change the affective function of humour</li>
    <li>What kinds of embodied knowledge are erased when platforms optimise for engagement</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Planned methods</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Computational analysis of short stand up clips and comedic videos that travel across at least two audience contexts</li>
    <li>Qualitative interviews with viewers and performers about how they read the same material in different spaces</li>
    <li>Practice based work that uses my own performances as small experiments, varying framing and pacing and documenting how responses change in rooms and online</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Where a PhD fits in</h2>
  <p>
    In PhD work I want to deepen this agenda in three related ways:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>anchor it in communication theory on affective publics and platform infrastructures</li>
    <li>connect it to performance studies work on liveness, embodiment and the line between room and archive</li>
    <li>build more precise mixed methods that combine practice, qualitative work and computational analysis</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Long term direction</h2>
  <p>
    I see myself as someone who moves between research and creative work. I want to write, perform and build tools, while also producing careful scholarship on how humour and storytelling are changing in an attention driven media environment.
